**Issues Fixed:**
- ✅ Simplified test structure
- ✅ Improved window.location mocking
- ✅ Removed redundant test cases
- ✅ Enhanced test isolation

#### Test Utilities (`apps/frontend/src/utils/test-utils.tsx`)
**Issues Fixed:**

- ✅ Troubleshooting section

## Test Status

### Backend Tests
- ✅ All backend tests passing
- ✅ Graceful shutdown warnings resolved
- ✅ Database and Redis connection cleanup implemented

### Frontend Tests
- ⚠️ Some test failures remain (9 failed test suites, 18 failed tests)
- ✅ Component-level issues resolved
- ✅ Utility-level issues resolved
- ⚠️ Integration test issues need further investigation

## Remaining Issues

### Frontend Test Failures
1. **Integration Tests**: App.test.tsx has module resolution issues
2. **API Mocking**: Some API service mocks may need refinement
3. **Environment Handling**: Some browser-specific APIs need better test environment handling

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Fix Integration Tests**: Resolve module resolution issues in App.test.tsx
2. **Enhance Test Environment**: Improve browser API mocking in test setup
3. **API Mock Refinement**: Ensure all API service methods are properly mocked
4. **Test Coverage**: Increase test coverage for critical components
