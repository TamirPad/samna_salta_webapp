# Project Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the cleanup process performed on the Samna Salta webapp project to improve code quality, organization, and maintainability.

## Cleanup Actions Completed

### 1. Code Quality Improvements
- **Removed console.log statements** from production code
- **Converted console.log to TODO comments** where appropriate
- **Cleaned up temporary files** and build artifacts
- **Organized code structure** following best practices

### 2. Files Cleaned
- ✅ Temporary files (*.tmp, *.temp, *.bak, *.backup, *~)
- ✅ Build directories (build/, dist/, coverage/)
- ✅ Cache directories (.cache, .parcel-cache, .turbo)
- ✅ Log files (*.log)
- ✅ Test artifacts (test-results/, playwright-report/)
- ✅ TypeScript build info (*.tsbuildinfo)
- ✅ Environment files (.env, .env.local, etc.)
- ✅ IDE files (.vscode/, .idea/, *.swp, *.swo)
- ✅ SSL certificates (*.pem, *.key, *.crt)

### 3. Code Organization
- **Updated render.yaml** with proper deployment configuration
- **Created Dockerfile.prod** for production Docker deployment
- **Added comprehensive documentation** for deployment and organization
- **Updated package.json** with cleanup and maintenance scripts

## Current Project State

### Code Quality Metrics
- **TODO Comments**: 10 remaining (need review and implementation)
- **Console.log Statements**: 13 remaining (mostly in test files and service workers)
- **Large Files**: 2 cache files identified (normal for development)

- Code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier)
- Git hooks for pre-commit checks

### 3. Deployment
- Render deployment configuration
- Docker production setup
- Environment variable management
- Health checks and monitoring

## Maintenance Schedule

### Daily Tasks
- Review and address TODO comments
- Check for console.log statements
- Monitor build and test status
- Review error logs

### Weekly Tasks
- Update dependencies
- Review code coverage
- Analyze bundle size
- Clean up unused code

### Monthly Tasks
